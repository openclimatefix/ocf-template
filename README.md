This section of the README should contain a brief description of the project.
Perhaps give a short amount of context around why it exists; the problem it solves.
By the end of reading this short paragraph, a contributor should not be confused
as to the purpose of the repository and its role in the organisation.

They might even have an idea of how it could be useful to them!

> [!Note]
> Any important callouts (informing visitors this repository is in early
> design stages, or not for general use, or requires a lot of prerequisite
> knowledge or infrastructure) should be placed in a note like this.
> Like: This repository does not hold template workflows, contributing
> guides, etc - head to
> [OCF's .github repository](https://github.com/openclimatefix/.github)
> for those.

## Installation

How to install the project for *general use* - **not** for development:
"`pip install x`", or "pull the latest checkpoint from `y`",
not "clone the repo and run `make install`".
For example, to "install" this template as the basis of a new repository,
do the following:

1. Click **Use this template** (in green) above the upper right of this file
2. Select **Create a new repository**
3. Create the new repository as desired

## Example usage

One or two short examples of using the project to solve a problem.
Quick happy-path examples that show the project in action or outline a
common use case.

> [!Note]
> If the project does not have a clear usage pattern, consider informing the
> user as such in the first callout. Then you can skip *Installation* and
> *Example usage* - perhaps replacing them with a *Quickstart* section -
> or just moving straight on to *Development*.

Once you have installed the project into a new GitHub repository,
`git clone` it and `cd` into the created directory.

**For a Python project:**

Modify the `pyproject.toml`
file, updating the name, description, authors, and dependencies as needed.
Install the project in editable mode (in a new virtual environment!)
with `pip install -e .`.

Also, importantly, update this README!

**For other projects:**

Simply delete `src` and `pyproject.toml`, and just use the README part of the template.

*For more information, head to the [Documentation](#documentation).*

## Documentation

Link to the project's documentation, if it exists. Also consider internal
linking to parts of interest of the documentation, such as **Development**,
**API**, **Configuration** and so on.

## Development

Anything specific to getting set up for development on the project: required libraries,
infrastructure, extra tools that may be desired ([MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), etc). Also, how to run tests!

Make sure you have the most up to date drivers for your 32 GPU array to use this template! 

> [!Note]
> The development section might be contained within the documentation, in which case
> remove the *Development* section, and instead specify links to the relevant parts
> of the documentation in the *Documentation* section.
